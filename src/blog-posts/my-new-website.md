I. Uh Who are you? \
II. Why I chose GatsbyJS and Chakra UI \
III. What I really liked \
IV. What I was meh about 

## Introductions are in order
Hello World, I’m Donovan and I’m trying to make cool things on the internet. I believe intros are in order for the two people reading this. Nice to meet you, I’m Donovan. I’ve been learning to code on and off for around the last two years. For the last two years I’ve kept quiet about this but I figured it's about time to come clean. I’ve been learning to code not for a huge silicon valley salary but I honestly want to make something cool. The last 10 years of my life in food service I very rarely got to feel like I created something with a team I was proud of. I hope I can make this dream into a reality. Part of getting a job though is I need a portfolio especially since I haven’t finished school. The portfolio has gone through many iterations already but this time I’ve tried to make it simple aesthetically while using GatsbyJS and Chakra UI.

## Why I chose Gatsby and Chakra.
The biggest reason I chose Gatsby and Chakra was honestly to learn something new. People seem to use their portfolio for experimentation. Now that might be a problem if I’m trying to get a job in the industry  but I tried to keep experimentation to the minimum. There’s obviously huge strengths that come with using new tech which I’ll go over. First with Gatsby.

## Gatsby:
All I heard from podcasts and people with clout on Twitter were that Gatsby was extremely fast. It’s Usain bolt fast. I just took a Google lighthouse score and scored a 100 on performance without really paying attention to trying to score so high. I’ve never scored a perfect 100 on anything in my life actually. There are other advantages like optimized images and the amazing plugin ecosystem.

## Chakra UI:
I’m gonna be straight up and say that I think Chakra UI is the most intuitive design framework out there. It’s extremely easy to implement both Flexbox and Grid. You essentially write utility classes that are your css properties, just camelCased. The most straightforward example I can give is regarding Chara’s <Flex>. <Flex> just renders a <div> element with a display: flex. From there if you want to justify your content to the center you only need to add a utility class of justifyContent=”center”. The same can be said with other css properties as utility classes. Dark mode is also in by default and it is extremely easy to implement with React hooks. I almost want to do a blog post to just shill Chakra UI in general. I am in love with it.

## The different stuff.
## Gatsby:
I have never written any GraphQL queries before. There is a slight learning curve and a bit of frustration when you need to install a plugin for an image, see the plugin is deprecated, use another plugin and finally write your page query to take full advantage of the plugin. It’s definitely worth it but not something I was used to. Back to the plugins, it seems like there is a plugin for everything and it's something I also was not used to. Plugins for transitions, images and even just to scroll to anchor links. It was also a new experience for that. The extra steps definitely will become easier over time and I’ve got GatsbyJS to thank me for letting me know about GraphQL and the Graphiql playground.

Chakra UI:
Honestly not much. I did have to find some workaround with styling the page templates. Gatsby will dynamically create a page and I didn’t know how to style a dangerouslysetInnerHTML element lol.
