## Introductions are in order
Hello World, I’m Donovan and I’m trying to make cool things on the internet. I believe intros are in order for the two people reading this. Nice to meet you, I’m Donovan. I’ve been learning to code on and off for around the last two years. For the last two years I’ve kept quiet about this but I figured it's about time to come clean. I’ve been learning to code not for a huge silicon valley salary but I honestly want to make something cool. The last 10 years of my life in food service I very rarely got to feel like I created something with a team I was proud of. I hope I can make this dream into a reality. Part of getting a job though is I need a portfolio especially since I haven’t finished school. My next post will be all about my portfolio and why I chose Gatsby.

Much Love,
Donovan
