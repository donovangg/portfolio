# Hello, World! I’m Lost

Hello world my name is Donovan. I’ve been on this coding journey on and off for around two years now. As I write this in October of 2021 I can confidently say I’m each of the following: lost, confused and frustrated. Myself, like so many other people, have turned to coding for a way out of a current job. I am currently in my 5th year of being a night time phone operator for a pharmacy. I come home and I’m exhausted. I feel like I can’t keep up with the many bootcamp grads and the amazing projects I see on r/webdev. That’s where I’ve messed up. 


I’m done comparing my journey to others. This is my own path. This blog is starting to prove to myself I can do this. I’m hoping that people who feel the same as myself can start to feel a little hope. Hello, World! Let’s do this.

Much Love,
Donovan
