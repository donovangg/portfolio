description: Anime streaming has been spread out lately and this website was built for the purpose of having a central location to see what anime is airing that season. The AniList API is updated with streaming locations throughout the season and that is where the data comes from.

## Project Purpose
With anime being more mainstream than ever, more and more streaming services have been picking certain shows up. It's extremely spread about now that it would be nice to have a place to see what is showing that season. If there's a link available to the first episode it will take you there.

## Tech Stack
NextJS was used to bootstrap it, styled components for styling and the AniList API was used for all the data. The AniList API is extremely vast so it was built on GraphQL. Which foreshadows what I struggled with.

## What I struggled with
Despite using GatsbyJS before using GraphQL was a whole new thing for me. People said its way easier but I wasn't sure how to even go about it since I was so used to rest. There was definitely a large learning curve but the GraphQL editor definitely did help.

## Lessons Learned and New Features?
I'm planning to polish up the site and to add search functionality. I definitely want to do this with voice actresses in the future.
