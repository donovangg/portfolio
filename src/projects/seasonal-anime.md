description: Anime streaming has been spread out lately and this website was built for the purpose of having a central location to see what anime is airing that season. The AniList API is updated with streaming locations throughout the season and that is where the data comes from.

## Project Purpose
With anime being more mainstream than ever, more and more streaming services have been picking certain shows up. Everything is so spread out that it's hard to keep track. Ideally I wanted links of every anime but with licensing issues some anime aren't available. 
## Tech Stack
React is what I'm familiar with so React is what I used. This project was initially just a single page with the current season. The project ended up being almost a Netflix clone to be able to make something a little bit more substantial I guess? I went and added more things like dynamic routing, before the page just linked to external websites. In terms of CSS-IN-JS I decided to keep an open mind. I do enjoy having scoped CSS because my CSS skills aren't the best, so having it scoped to each component.

## What I struggled with
Despite using GatsbyJS before using GraphQL was a whole new thing for me. People said its way easier but I wasn't sure how to even go about it since I was so used to REST. There was definitely a learning curve. The AniList Graphiql editor and documentation were a large help. I definitely saw the light with being able to choose what I want from the API. Being able to get to choose what I wanted in the payload instead of recieving everything is extremely here. 

## Lessons Learned and New Features?
I'm planning to polish up the site and to add search functionality.
