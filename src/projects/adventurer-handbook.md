description: A fullstack web app dedicated to daily tasks in the video game Genshin Impact. Characters and weapons are stored on Supabase's postgres database. Once the data is retrieved it is rendered by the current day of the week to display the characters that are able to level up. There is CRUD functionality with the Todolist so players can plan out their session.
