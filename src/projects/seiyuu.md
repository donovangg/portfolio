## Project Purpose
A website that hits an api and returns search results for voice actresses.

## Tech Stack
React on the frontend calling the Jikan API. I was on a search for the best anime api I could find so I've used Jikan and Anilist on my various projects

## What I struggled with
Error handling was something new and also using conditional rendering to display the top seiyuu on the homepage.

## Lessons Learned and New Features?
I had a good walkthrough with error handling and conditional rendering with this projects. There are a bunch of things to consider when handling user input.
