## Project Explanation
A static website for a Venice based musician and friend. The main goal of a website is to condense all of his links on one site. Saliou has music available on Spotify, Bandcamp, Soundcloud and on YouTube. Having all of the streaming links in one place lets the user use the streaming service they normally use. HTML / SCSS really was the best thing for the job. Once he grows I might use GatsbyJS to be able to improve the speed and lighthouse scores.
